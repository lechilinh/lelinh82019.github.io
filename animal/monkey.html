                        Monkey is a common name that may refer to groups or species of mammals, in part, the simians of infraorder
                        Simiiformes. The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates, such as families of new world monkeys
                        and old world monkeys. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that
                        live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are also active during the day (diurnal).
                        Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the old world monkeys of Catarrhini.
                        Simians and tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago. New World monkeys and catarrhine
                        monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago. Old World monkeys and Hominoidea emerged
                        within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago. Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or
                        Parapithecus [35-32 million years ago], eosimiidea and sometimes even the Catarrhini group are also
                        considered monkeys by primatologists. <br><br>

                        Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys; instead they are strepsirrhine primates. Like monkeys,
                        tarsiers are haplorhine primates; however, they are also not monkeys.
                        According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word "monkey" may originate in a German version of the
                        Reynard the Fox fable, published circa 1580. In this version of the fable, a character named Moneke is the
                        son of Martin the Ape.[21] In English, no very clear distinction was originally made between "ape" and
                        "monkey"; thus the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica entry for "ape" notes that it is either a synonym for
                        "monkey" or is used to mean a tailless humanlike primate.[22] Colloquially, the terms "monkey" and "ape" are
                        widely used interchangeably.[23] Also, a few monkey species have the word "ape" in their common name, such
                        as the Barbary ape.
